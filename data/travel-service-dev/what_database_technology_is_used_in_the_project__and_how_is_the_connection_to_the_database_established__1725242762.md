Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What database technology is used in the project, and how is the connection to the database established?

Based on the provided information and the content of the MongoConfig.java and MongoConstant.java files, we can conclude the following:

1. Database Technology:
   The project uses MongoDB as its database technology. This is evident from the use of MongoDB-specific classes and configurations in the MongoConfig.java file.

2. Connection Establishment:
   The connection to the MongoDB database is established using Spring Data MongoDB, which is a part of the larger Spring Data project. Here's how the connection is set up:

   a. MongoClient Injection:
      - The MongoConfig class has a constructor that takes a MongoClient as a parameter.
      - This MongoClient is being injected by Spring's dependency injection system.
      - The actual creation and configuration of the MongoClient is not visible in these files, suggesting it's handled elsewhere in the application.

   b. MongoTemplate Configuration:
      - The mongoTemplate() method in MongoConfig creates and returns a MongoTemplate bean.
      - MongoTemplate is a helper class in Spring Data MongoDB that simplifies database operations.
      - It's created using the injected MongoClient and a constant MONGO_DB_NAME.

   c. Database Name:
      - The database name is defined as a constant (MONGO_DB_NAME) in the MongoConstant class.
      - The value of MONGO_DB_NAME is "travel", which is the name of the MongoDB database used in this application.

3. Spring Integration:
   - The @Configuration annotation on the MongoConfig class indicates that this is a Spring configuration class.
   - The @Bean annotation on the mongoTemplate() method tells Spring to manage the MongoTemplate instance as a bean in its application context.

4. Abstraction Level:
   - The use of MongoTemplate provides a high-level abstraction over direct MongoDB operations.
   - This approach allows for easier database interactions and query executions in the rest of the application.

However, there are some important details missing:

1. The actual MongoDB connection details (host, port, authentication) are not visible in the provided files.
2. We don't have information about where the MongoClient is configured, which typically contains these connection details.
3. There's no application.properties or application.yml file visible, which are common places to store database connection information in Spring Boot applications.

To get a more complete picture of the database setup, we would need to examine:
1. Other configuration classes that might contain MongoDB connection details
2. Any custom configuration for MongoClient, if it exists

In conclusion, while we can confirm that MongoDB is used and see how the MongoTemplate is set up, we're missing crucial information about the actual database connection parameters. This setup suggests that the project is using a modular approach to configuration, separating concerns between different configuration files and classes.
