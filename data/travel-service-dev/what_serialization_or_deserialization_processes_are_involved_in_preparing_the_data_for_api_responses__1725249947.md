Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What serialization or deserialization processes are involved in preparing the data for API responses?

To analyze the serialization and deserialization processes in this Java project, we need to focus on how data is converted between Java objects and formats suitable for API responses, typically JSON. This process is crucial for preparing data to be sent over the network and for parsing incoming data from API requests.

1. High-level overview:
In a Spring Boot application, which this project appears to be, serialization and deserialization are often handled automatically by the framework, particularly through the use of libraries like Jackson. However, we need to look for any custom configurations or annotations that might be influencing this process.

2. Key areas to investigate:
   a. DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes
   b. Controller classes
   c. Configuration classes
   d. Custom serializers or deserializers, if any

Let's start by examining the DTO classes, as they are typically the objects that get serialized for API responses.

We know there's a CityDTO class in the com.iky.travel.domain.dto package. This class is likely used for serialization when sending city data in API responses.

To get more information about how this DTO is structured and if it has any specific serialization annotations, we need to examine its content.
