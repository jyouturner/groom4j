Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: Which classes or interfaces are responsible for retrieving data from the database?

Based on the project structure and the information provided, we can identify several components that are likely responsible for retrieving data from the database:

1. Repository Layer:
   The package `com.iky.travel.domain.repository` is a strong indicator of classes that interact with the database. In particular:

   - `com.iky.travel.domain.repository.city.CityRepository`: This interface is likely extending a Spring Data repository interface (such as JpaRepository or MongoRepository) and would be responsible for CRUD operations on City entities.

2. Service Layer:
   While services don't directly interact with the database, they often encapsulate the repository calls. The package `com.iky.travel.domain.service` likely contains service classes that use repositories to fetch data. Specifically:

   - `com.iky.travel.domain.service.city.impl.CityServiceImpl`: This class probably uses CityRepository to perform database operations.

3. Configuration:
   The presence of `MongoConfig.java` in the `com.iky.travel.config` package suggests that the application is using MongoDB as its database. This configuration class might set up the connection to the database.

To get a more detailed understanding, we need to examine the contents of these files, particularly the repository and service implementations.
