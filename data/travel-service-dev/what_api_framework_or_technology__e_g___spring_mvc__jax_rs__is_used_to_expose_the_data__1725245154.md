Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What API framework or technology (e.g., Spring MVC, JAX-RS) is used to expose the data?

Based on the information provided, we can confidently conclude that this project uses Spring MVC as the API framework to expose the data. Here's the evidence supporting this conclusion:

1. Annotations:
   - The `CityController` class is annotated with `@RestController`, which is a Spring MVC annotation used to create RESTful web services.
   - The class-level `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler classes and/or handler methods.
   - Method-level annotations such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` are used to map HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to specific handler methods. These are all part of the Spring MVC framework.

2. Imports:
   - The presence of `import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*` in multiple files, including `CityController.java`, indicates the use of Spring MVC annotations.
   - Other Spring-related imports are present, such as `org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity` and `org.springframework.web.servlet.support.ServletUriComponentsBuilder`.

3. Controller Structure:
   - The `CityController` class follows the typical structure of a Spring MVC REST controller, with methods annotated to handle different HTTP methods and paths.

4. Request and Response Handling:
   - The controller methods use Spring MVC's `ResponseEntity` class to build HTTP responses with appropriate status codes and bodies.
   - Request body parsing is handled using the `@RequestBody` annotation, which is a Spring MVC feature for binding request payload to method parameters.

5. Validation:
   - The use of `@Valid` annotation on method parameters indicates the integration of Bean Validation with Spring MVC for request validation.

6. Exception Handling:
   - The presence of `GlobalExceptionHandler` and `ApiExceptionHandler` classes annotated with `@RestController` suggests the use of Spring MVC's global exception handling capabilities.

7. Dependency Injection:
   - The constructor-based dependency injection of `CityService` in the `CityController` is a common pattern in Spring applications.

8. URI Building:
   - The use of `ServletUriComponentsBuilder` to build URIs for newly created resources is a Spring MVC utility.

All these factors strongly indicate that the project is using Spring MVC as the API framework to expose the data. Spring MVC is a part of the larger Spring Framework ecosystem, which also explains the presence of other Spring-related components like Spring Data MongoDB (as evidenced by `MongoRepository` and `MongoTemplate` usage mentioned in the previous notes).

This choice of framework provides several benefits for the project:
1. It offers a robust and well-established ecosystem for building web applications and RESTful services.
2. It integrates well with other Spring components, such as Spring Data for database operations.
3. It provides powerful features for request mapping, data binding, validation, and exception handling.
4. It allows for easy testing and dependency injection, which are crucial for maintaining a large-scale application.

In conclusion, the project is leveraging Spring MVC to create a RESTful API for managing city-related operations in a travel application. This framework choice aligns well with the project's structure and requirements, providing a solid foundation for building and maintaining a scalable web service.
