Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What database technology is used in the project, and how is the connection to the database established?

To answer this question, we need to look for configuration files and dependencies related to database technologies. Let's start by examining the project structure and relevant files.

1. High-level overview:
From the project structure, we can see a configuration package (com.iky.travel.config) which likely contains database configuration files. Additionally, we should look for any database-related constants or repository classes.

2. Diving deeper:
Let's examine the configuration package first.
