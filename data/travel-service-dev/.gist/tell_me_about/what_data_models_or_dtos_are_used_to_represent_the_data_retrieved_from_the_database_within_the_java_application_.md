Based on the search results, we have identified several classes that are likely used as data models or DTOs within the Java application. Let's analyze these classes to understand how they represent the data retrieved from the database.

### Identified Classes

1. **City.java** (Located in `src/main/java/com/iky/travel/domain/model/City.java`)
   - This class is annotated with `@Data`, which is a Lombok annotation that generates getters, setters, `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods, among others.
   - The presence of `@Data` suggests that this class is used as a data model.

2. **CityDTO.java** (Located in `src/main/java/com/iky/travel/domain/dto/CityDTO.java`)
   - This class is annotated with `@Getter` and `@Setter`, which are Lombok annotations that generate getter and setter methods for the fields.
   - The name `CityDTO` and the annotations indicate that this class is used as a Data Transfer Object (DTO).

3. **ValidationErrorResponse.java** (Located in `src/main/java/com/iky/travel/exception/ValidationErrorResponse.java`)
   - This class is annotated with `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@AllArgsConstructor`.
   - It appears to be used for handling validation error responses, which may not be directly related to database data models but is still relevant for data transfer.

4. **ApiErrorResponse.java** (Located in `src/main/java/com/iky/travel/exception/ApiErrorResponse.java`)
   - Similar to `ValidationErrorResponse`, this class is annotated with `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@AllArgsConstructor`.
   - It is likely used for handling API error responses.

### Analysis of Key Classes

#### City.java
```java
package com.iky.travel.domain.model;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class City {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String country;
}
```
- **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `country`
- **Annotations**: `@Data`
- **Role**: This class represents a city entity with fields that likely map to database columns. The `@Data` annotation simplifies the creation of boilerplate code.

#### CityDTO.java
```java
package com.iky.travel.domain.dto;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
public class CityDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String country;
}
```
- **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `country`
- **Annotations**: `@Getter`, `@Setter`
- **Role**: This class is used to transfer city data between different layers of the application. The `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations generate the necessary accessor methods.

#### ValidationErrorResponse.java
```java
package com.iky.travel.exception;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
public class ValidationErrorResponse {
    private String field;
    private String message;
}
```
- **Fields**: `field`, `message`
- **Annotations**: `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@AllArgsConstructor`
- **Role**: This class is used to represent validation error responses, which are likely sent to the client when validation errors occur.

#### ApiErrorResponse.java
```java
package com.iky.travel.exception;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
public class ApiErrorResponse {
    private String error;
    private String message;
}
```
- **Fields**: `error`, `message`
- **Annotations**: `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@AllArgsConstructor`
- **Role**: This class is used to represent API error responses, which are likely sent to the client when API errors occur.

### Summary

Based on the analysis, the primary data models and DTOs used to represent data retrieved from the database are:

- **City.java**: A data model representing a city entity with fields `id`, `name`, and `country`.
- **CityDTO.java**: A DTO used to transfer city data with fields `id`, `name`, and `country`.

Additionally, there are classes for handling error responses:

- **ValidationErrorResponse.java**: Represents validation error responses with fields `field` and `message`.
- **ApiErrorResponse.java**: Represents API error responses with fields `error` and `message`.

### Key Findings

- [DATA_MODEL] `City.java` is used as a data model representing a city entity.
- [DTO] `CityDTO.java` is used as a Data Transfer Object for city data.
- [ERROR_HANDLING] `ValidationErrorResponse.java` and `ApiErrorResponse.java` are used for handling validation and API error responses, respectively.

### Next Steps

If further details are needed, such as the specific usage of these classes within the application, we can request additional information or file contents. However, based on the current analysis, we have a clear understanding of the primary data models and DTOs used in the application.
