Based on the provided information, I can confidently answer the question about which API framework or technology is used to expose the data in this project.

The project uses Spring MVC, which is part of the Spring Framework, to expose the data through RESTful APIs. This conclusion is supported by several key observations:

1. Use of Spring Web annotations:
   Both CityController and TravelController classes are annotated with @RestController, which is a Spring-specific annotation used to create RESTful web services. This annotation combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, indicating that the class is a controller and that the return value of the methods should be bound to the web response body.

2. Request mapping:
   The controllers use @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping annotations, which are all part of Spring MVC's request handling mechanism.

3. ResponseEntity usage:
   The controller methods return ResponseEntity objects, which is a Spring class representing the entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body.

4. Dependency Injection:
   The controllers use constructor-based dependency injection, which is a common pattern in Spring applications.

5. Exception handling:
   The application uses custom exceptions and likely has a global exception handler (as evidenced by the presence of ApiExceptionHandler.java), which is a typical approach in Spring MVC applications.

6. Validation:
   The use of @Valid annotation for request body validation is supported by Spring's integration with Jakarta Bean Validation.

These features are all characteristic of Spring MVC, which is built on top of the core Spring framework and provides a powerful model-view-controller architecture for building web applications and RESTful web services.

The project doesn't show any signs of using other Java API frameworks like JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) or alternative frameworks such as Micronaut or Quarkus. The consistent use of Spring annotations and patterns throughout the controller layer clearly indicates that Spring MVC is the chosen framework for exposing the API in this travel application.

In conclusion, the API framework used to expose the data in this project is Spring MVC, which is part of the broader Spring ecosystem.
