### Analysis of the API Request `/api/v1/city/New%20York`

#### 1. **Trace the Request through the Code**

**Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Request Handling in `CityController`:**
   - The request `/api/v1/city/New%20York` is mapped to the `getCity` method in the `CityController` class.
   - The `@GetMapping("{city}")` annotation ensures that the `getCity` method is invoked with the path variable `city` set to "New York".

   ```java
   @GetMapping("{city}")
   public ResponseEntity<CityDTO> getCity(@PathVariable String city) {
       Optional<CityDTO> cityDTO = cityService.getCity(city);
       if (cityDTO.isEmpty()) {
           throw new CityNotFoundException("City not found: " + city);
       }
       return ResponseEntity.ok(cityDTO.get());
   }
   ```

2. **Service Layer in `CityServiceImpl`:**
   - The `getCity` method in `CityController` calls the `getCity` method of the `CityService` interface, which is implemented by `CityServiceImpl`.

   ```java
   @Override
   public Optional<CityDTO> getCity(String cityName) {
       CityDTO cityDTO = hashOperations.get(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName);
       if (cityDTO != null) {
           incrementCityQueryCount(cityName);
           return Optional.of(cityDTO);
       }
       Optional<City> optionalCity = cityRepository.findByName(cityName);
       if (optionalCity.isPresent()) {
           cityDTO = CityMapper.INSTANCE.cityToDto(optionalCity.get());
           if ("New York".equals(cityName)) {
               List<String> activities = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(cityDTO.getTopActivities()));
               activities.add("reading book");
               cityDTO.setTopActivities(activities.toArray(new String[0]));
           }
           hashOperations.put(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName, cityDTO);
           incrementCityQueryCount(cityName);
           return Optional.of(cityDTO);
       }
       return Optional.empty();
   }
   ```

3. **Cache Check:**
   - The `getCity` method first checks the Redis cache using `hashOperations.get(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName)`.
   - If the city data is found in the cache, it increments the query count and returns the cached `CityDTO`.

4. **Database Query:**
   - If the city data is not found in the cache, it queries the `CityRepository` to fetch the city from the database using `cityRepository.findByName(cityName)`.

5. **Special Business Rule for "New York":**
   - If the city is "New York", an additional activity "reading book" is added to the `topActivities` list before returning the `CityDTO`.

6. **Cache Update:**
   - The city data is then cached in Redis for future requests using `hashOperations.put(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName, cityDTO)`.

7. **Increment Query Count:**
   - The query count for the city is incremented in a Redis sorted set using `incrementCityQueryCount(cityName)`.

#### 2. **Response Data for this Request**

- The response data is a `CityDTO` object representing the city "New York".
- It includes the city's details and an additional activity "reading book" in the `topActivities` list.

#### 3. **Special Business Rules or Implementation Details**

- **Caching in Redis:**
  - The city data is cached in Redis for faster retrieval. This reduces the load on the database for frequently accessed cities.

- **Special Business Rule for "New York":**
  - A special business rule adds "reading book" to the `topActivities` list for "New York".

- **Data Mapping:**
  - The `CityServiceImpl` uses a `CityMapper` to convert between `CityDTO` and `City` entities.

- **Popular Destinations Tracking:**
  - Popular destinations are tracked using a Redis sorted set, incrementing the query count for each city request.

### Summary

- The request `/api/v1/city/New%20York` is processed by the `CityController`, which delegates to the `CityServiceImpl`.
- The `CityServiceImpl` checks the Redis cache and, if necessary, queries the database.
- For "New York", an additional activity "reading book" is added to the `topActivities`.
- The response is a `CityDTO` object with the city's details and the additional activity.
- Special business rules include caching in Redis and tracking popular destinations.
