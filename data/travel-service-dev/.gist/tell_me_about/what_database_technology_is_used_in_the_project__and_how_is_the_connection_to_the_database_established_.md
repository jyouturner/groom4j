Based on the information provided, I can give a comprehensive answer about the database technologies used in the project and how the connections are established.

1. Database Technologies:
   The project uses two main database technologies:

   a) MongoDB: This is the primary database used for persistent storage of data. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

   b) Redis: This is used as a caching layer and for storing certain types of data that require fast access. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.

2. Connection Establishment:

   a) MongoDB Connection:
   The connection to MongoDB is established through the MongoConfig class in the com.iky.travel.config package. This class is responsible for configuring the MongoDB connection and providing a MongoTemplate bean for database operations. The actual connection details (like host, port, credentials) are likely specified in the application.yaml file, which is then used by Spring Boot to automatically configure the MongoDB connection.

   b) Redis Connection:
   The Redis connection is set up through the RedisConfig class, also in the com.iky.travel.config package. This class configures the Redis connection and provides a RedisTemplate bean for Redis operations. Similar to MongoDB, the connection details for Redis are likely specified in the application.yaml file.

3. Configuration Details:
   - Both MongoDB and Redis configurations use Spring's dependency injection, as evidenced by the use of constructor injection in MongoConfig and method parameter injection in RedisConfig.
   - The configuration classes use @Bean annotations to define Spring beans for MongoTemplate and RedisTemplate, which are then used throughout the application for database operations.

4. Usage in the Application:
   - MongoDB is used for storing persistent data, such as City entities. This is evident from the CityRepository interface which extends MongoRepository, and the @Document annotation on the City model class.
   - Redis is used for caching and possibly for storing frequently accessed data or session information. The CityServiceImpl class, for example, uses Redis for caching city data and tracking popular destinations.

5. Exception Handling:
   The application includes custom exception handling for Redis operations (RedisException), indicating a robust error handling mechanism for database operations.

In conclusion, the project uses a combination of MongoDB for persistent storage and Redis for caching and fast data access. The connections to these databases are established and configured using Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities, with additional custom configuration provided in the MongoConfig and RedisConfig classes. This setup allows for a flexible, scalable, and high-performance data management solution in the travel application.

I believe this information sufficiently answers the question about the database technologies used and how connections are established. If you need any further clarification or have additional questions, please let me know.
