Based on the provided information, I can now analyze how the retrieved data is mapped or transformed into objects or DTOs for use in the API. Let's break down the process:

1. Data Retrieval and Mapping:
   The CityServiceImpl class is responsible for retrieving data from both Redis cache and MongoDB database. When a city is requested, the following process occurs:

   a. Check Redis cache:
      - The service first checks if the city data is available in Redis cache.
      - If found, it returns the CityDTO directly from the cache.

   b. Check MongoDB:
      - If not found in cache, it queries the MongoDB database using CityRepository.
      - The database returns a City entity object.

   c. Mapping:
      - If the city is found in the database, it's mapped from the City entity to a CityDTO using CityMapper.
      - The mapping is done using MapStruct, as defined in the CityMapper interface:
        ```java
        CityDTO cityToDto(City city);
        ```

2. CityMapper:
   The CityMapper interface, implemented by MapStruct, provides the mapping between City entities and CityDTOs. It defines two methods:
   ```java
   City dtoToCity(CityDTO cityDTO);
   CityDTO cityToDto(City city);
   ```
   These methods handle the bidirectional mapping between entities and DTOs.

3. DTO Structure:
   The CityDTO class is designed to transfer city data between layers. It includes:
   - Fields representing city attributes (id, plateNo, name, population, country, topActivities)
   - Validation annotations to ensure data integrity
   - Lombok annotations (@Getter, @Setter) for automatic generation of getters and setters

4. API Response:
   In the CityController, the mapped CityDTO is returned as part of the ResponseEntity:
   ```java
   return ResponseEntity.ok(cityDTO.get());
   ```

5. Caching:
   After retrieving and mapping the data, the CityDTO is cached in Redis for faster subsequent access:
   ```java
   hashOperations.put(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName, cityDTO);
   ```

6. Bidirectional Mapping:
   The system supports both entity-to-DTO and DTO-to-entity mapping:
   - When adding or updating a city, the incoming CityDTO is mapped to a City entity before saving to the database.
   - When retrieving a city, the City entity is mapped to a CityDTO before being returned or cached.

In summary, the data transformation process in this application involves:
1. Retrieving data from Redis cache or MongoDB database
2. Using MapStruct (via CityMapper) to map between City entities and CityDTOs
3. Caching the mapped DTOs in Redis for improved performance
4. Returning the DTOs as part of the API response

This approach ensures a clean separation between the database representation (City entity) and the API representation (CityDTO), allowing for flexibility in both the persistence and presentation layers.

I believe I have sufficient information to fully answer the question about how retrieved data is mapped or transformed into objects or DTOs for use in the API. The combination of Spring Data MongoDB, Redis caching, MapStruct for object mapping, and the use of DTOs provides a comprehensive and efficient system for data transformation in this travel application.
