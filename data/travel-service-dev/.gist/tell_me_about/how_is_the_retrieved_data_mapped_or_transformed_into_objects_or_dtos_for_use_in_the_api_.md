Based on the provided information, I can now answer the question "How is the retrieved data mapped or transformed into objects or DTOs for use in the API?" Let's analyze the relevant components and their roles in this process.

KEY_FINDINGS:
- [ARCHITECTURE] The application uses a layered architecture with clear separation between domain models, DTOs, and mappers.
- [IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL] MapStruct is used for object mapping between domain models and DTOs.
- [DATA_FLOW] Data is transformed from domain models to DTOs before being sent to the API layer.
- [BUSINESS_RULE] DTOs include validation annotations to ensure data integrity during transfer.

The data mapping and transformation process in this application involves several components:

1. Domain Model:
The City class in com.iky.travel.domain.model package represents the core domain entity. It is annotated with @Document(collection = "cities"), indicating that it's directly mapped to a MongoDB collection.

2. Data Transfer Object (DTO):
The CityDTO class in com.iky.travel.domain.dto package is used for transferring city data between different layers of the application, particularly to and from the API layer. It includes validation annotations to ensure data integrity.

3. Mapper:
The CityMapper interface in com.iky.travel.domain.mapper package defines the contract for mapping between City domain objects and CityDTO objects. It uses MapStruct, a code generation tool, to implement the actual mapping logic.

The process of mapping and transforming data likely follows this flow:

1. Data Retrieval: When data is retrieved from the MongoDB database, it's initially in the form of City domain objects.

2. Mapping to DTO: Before sending the data to the API layer, the City objects are mapped to CityDTO objects using the CityMapper.

3. Validation: The CityDTO objects include validation annotations, ensuring that the data meets certain criteria before being sent through the API.

4. API Response: The CityDTO objects are then used in the API responses, providing a clean and controlled interface for data transfer.

For incoming data (e.g., when adding or updating a city), the process is reversed:

1. API Request: The API receives data in the form of CityDTO objects.

2. Validation: The validation annotations on CityDTO ensure that the incoming data meets the required criteria.

3. Mapping to Domain Object: The validated CityDTO is then mapped back to a City domain object using the CityMapper.

4. Persistence: The City domain object is then persisted to the MongoDB database.

The use of MapStruct for object mapping is a notable implementation detail. MapStruct generates the mapping code at compile-time, which can lead to better performance compared to reflection-based mapping libraries.

This architecture provides several benefits:
1. Separation of Concerns: The domain model is kept separate from the data transfer objects, allowing each to evolve independently.
2. Data Integrity: Validation at the DTO level ensures that only valid data is processed.
3. Flexibility: Changes to the internal domain model don't necessarily affect the external API contract, and vice versa.

In conclusion, the application uses a well-structured approach to map and transform data between its domain model and the API layer. The use of DTOs, coupled with MapStruct for efficient object mapping, provides a clean and maintainable way to handle data transformation while ensuring data integrity through validation.

I believe I have sufficient information to answer the question comprehensively. However, if you need more details on specific aspects of this process, please let me know.
