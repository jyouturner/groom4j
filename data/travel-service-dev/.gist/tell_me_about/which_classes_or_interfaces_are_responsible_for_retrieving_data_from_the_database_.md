Based on the new information provided, I can now give a more comprehensive answer to the question "Which classes or interfaces are responsible for retrieving data from the database?"

1. CityRepository Interface:
The CityRepository interface is the primary component responsible for direct database operations related to the City entity. It extends MongoRepository<City, String>, which provides basic CRUD operations for City objects in MongoDB. Additionally, it defines two custom methods:

a. findByName(String name): This method retrieves a City entity from the database based on its name. It returns an Optional<City>, allowing for null-safe operations.

b. deleteByName(String name): This method deletes a City entity from the database based on its name. It returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful.

2. CityServiceImpl Class:
The CityServiceImpl class acts as an intermediary between the controller layer and the repository layer. It uses both the CityRepository for database operations and Redis for caching. Here's how it retrieves data:

a. getCity(String cityName): This method first checks the Redis cache for the city. If found, it returns the cached data. If not found in cache, it queries the database using cityRepository.findByName(cityName). If found in the database, it caches the result in Redis before returning.

b. cityExists(String cityName): This method first checks the Redis cache, and if not found, it queries the database using cityRepository.findByName(cityName).

c. addCity(CityDTO cityDTO): After checking for existence, it saves the new city to the database using cityRepository.save(city) and then caches it in Redis.

d. updateCity(CityDTO updatedCity): It updates the city in the database using cityRepository.save(city) and then updates the cache in Redis.

e. deleteCity(String cityName): It deletes the city from both Redis cache and the database using cityRepository.deleteByName(cityName).

In conclusion, the primary classes responsible for retrieving data from the database are:

1. CityRepository: Directly interacts with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on City entities.
2. CityServiceImpl: Uses CityRepository to interact with the database and also manages a Redis cache for improved performance.

The CityServiceImpl implements a caching strategy where it first checks Redis for data, and if not found, queries the MongoDB database. This approach helps to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

I believe this information is sufficient to fully answer the question about which classes or interfaces are responsible for retrieving data from the database in this project.
