### Thought 1: Investigate Custom Configuration Management

#### Description
Since no standard configuration files or environment variables were found, investigate if the project uses a custom configuration management system. This could involve custom classes or methods designed to handle configuration settings, including database credentials.

#### Pros
- Directly addresses the possibility of custom solutions for configuration management.
- Can uncover unique security measures implemented by the developers.

#### Cons
- Requires a thorough review of the codebase to identify custom configuration management.
- May be time-consuming if the custom solution is complex or poorly documented.

#### Relation to Other Thoughts
- This approach focuses on internal, custom solutions, whereas other thoughts may look at external libraries or services.

### Thought 2: Examine Dependency Injection and Security Annotations

#### Description
Investigate the use of dependency injection frameworks (e.g., Spring, CDI) and security annotations (e.g., `@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`) to manage and secure database connections. This includes checking for any custom security annotations or aspects.

#### Pros
- Can identify secure coding practices and frameworks used to manage database connections.
- May reveal security measures applied at the framework level.

#### Cons
- Requires knowledge of specific frameworks and their security features.
- May miss security measures implemented outside the dependency injection framework.

#### Relation to Other Thoughts
- This approach focuses on the use of frameworks and annotations, while other thoughts may look at custom code or third-party services.

### Thought 3: Review Logging and Error Handling for Sensitive Information

#### Description
Examine the logging and error handling mechanisms in the codebase to ensure that sensitive information, such as database credentials, is not inadvertently logged or exposed in error messages. This includes checking for the use of secure logging libraries and practices.

#### Pros
- Addresses a common security concern related to the exposure of sensitive information.
- Can identify potential vulnerabilities in logging and error handling practices.

#### Cons
- May not directly address the storage and encryption of database credentials.
- Requires a thorough review of logging and error handling code.

#### Relation to Other Thoughts
- This approach focuses on the security of logging and error handling, whereas other thoughts may focus on configuration management or dependency injection.

### Next Steps

To proceed with these approaches, we need to gather specific information from the codebase:

1. **Search for Keywords Related to Custom Configuration Management:**
   [I need to search for keywords: <keyword>Config</keyword>, <keyword>Configuration</keyword>, <keyword>Settings</keyword>, <keyword>Properties</keyword>, <keyword>Credentials</keyword>]

2. **Search for Keywords Related to Dependency Injection and Security Annotations:**
   [I need to search for keywords: <keyword>@Inject</keyword>, <keyword>@Autowired</keyword>, <keyword>@Secured</keyword>, <keyword>@RolesAllowed</keyword>, <keyword>@Security</keyword>]

3. **Search for Keywords Related to Logging and Error Handling:**
   [I need to search for keywords: <keyword>log</keyword>, <keyword>Logger</keyword>, <keyword>error</keyword>, <keyword>exception</keyword>, <keyword>stack trace</keyword>]

By gathering information based on these keywords, we can better understand the security measures implemented in the project and provide a comprehensive answer to the question.
