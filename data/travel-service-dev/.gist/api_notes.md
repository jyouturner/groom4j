Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the API endpoints for the City operations in the travel application. Let's break down each endpoint according to the requested format:

## Get City

1. **Purpose**: Retrieve information about a specific city.

2. **Functionality**: This endpoint fetches detailed information about a city based on its name.

3. **Request Structure**:
   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Path: `/api/v1/city/{city}`
   - Path parameters: `city` (String)

4. **Response Structure**:
   - Response body: CityDTO object
   - Possible status codes: 
     - 200 OK (successful retrieval)
     - 404 Not Found (if city doesn't exist)

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `getCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The `cityService.getCity(city)` method is called, passing the city name.
   - In `CityServiceImpl`, the following steps occur:
     - First, it checks the Redis cache using `hashOperations.get(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName)`.
     - If found in cache, it increments the city query count and returns the CityDTO.
     - If not in cache, it queries the database using `cityRepository.findByName(cityName)`.
     - If found in the database, it converts the City entity to CityDTO, caches it in Redis, increments the query count, and returns the DTO.
     - If not found in the database, it returns an empty Optional.
   - Back in the controller, if the `Optional` is empty, a `CityNotFoundException` is thrown.
   - If the city exists, the CityDTO is wrapped in a ResponseEntity and returned with a 200 OK status.

6. **Data Processing**: 
   - The main transformation happens in `CityMapper.INSTANCE.cityToDto(optionalCity.get())`, converting the database entity to a DTO.
   - Caching mechanism: Redis is used to cache city data, improving retrieval speed for subsequent requests.
   - The `incrementCityQueryCount` method updates a sorted set in Redis, tracking popular destinations.

7. **Key Classes/Methods**: 
   - `CityController.getCity(String city)`
   - `CityServiceImpl.getCity(String cityName)`
   - `CityRepository.findByName(String name)`
   - `CityMapper.INSTANCE.cityToDto(City city)`
   - `CityServiceImpl.incrementCityQueryCount(String cityName)`

## Delete City

1. **Purpose**: Remove a city from the system.

2. **Functionality**: This endpoint deletes a city based on its name from both the database and cache.

3. **Request Structure**:
   - HTTP Method: DELETE
   - Path: `/api/v1/city/{city}`
   - Path parameters: `city` (String)

4. **Response Structure**:
   - Response body: String (success message)
   - Possible status codes: 
     - 200 OK (successful deletion)
     - 500 Internal Server Error (if deletion fails)

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `deleteCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The `cityService.deleteCity(city)` method is called, passing the city name.
   - In `CityServiceImpl`, the following steps occur:
     - It attempts to delete the city from Redis cache using `hashOperations.delete(generateRedisKey(cityName), cityName)`.
     - It then attempts to delete the city from the database using `cityRepository.deleteByName(cityName)`.
     - If any exception occurs during this process, a `CityDeleteException` is thrown.
   - If deletion is successful, a success message is returned with a 200 OK status.

6. **Data Processing**: 
   - The deletion process involves removing data from both Redis cache and the database.
   - There's no explicit data transformation in this operation.

7. **Key Classes/Methods**: 
   - `CityController.deleteCity(String city)`
   - `CityServiceImpl.deleteCity(String cityName)`
   - `CityRepository.deleteByName(String name)`

## Add City

1. **Purpose**: Add a new city to the system.

2. **Functionality**: This endpoint creates a new city entry based on the provided data, storing it in both the database and cache.

3. **Request Structure**:
   - HTTP Method: POST
   - Path: `/api/v1/city`
   - Request body: CityDTO object

4. **Response Structure**:
   - Response body: Empty
   - Possible status codes: 
     - 201 Created (successful addition)
     - 400 Bad Request (if validation fails)
     - 409 Conflict (if city already exists)

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `addCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The incoming CityDTO is validated (due to `@Valid` annotation).
   - The `cityService.addCity(cityDTO)` method is called, passing the validated CityDTO.
   - In `CityServiceImpl`, the following steps occur:
     - It checks if the city already exists using `cityExists(cityDTO.getName())`.
     - If the city exists, a `CityAlreadyExistsException` is thrown.
     - If not, it converts the CityDTO to a City entity using `CityMapper.INSTANCE.dtoToCity(cityDTO)`.
     - The City entity is saved to the database using `cityRepository.save(city)`.
     - The CityDTO is cached in Redis using `hashOperations.put(generateRedisKey(city.getName()), city.getName(), cityDTO)`.
   - If the addition is successful, a 201 Created response is sent with the location of the new resource.
   - If the addition fails, a `CityAddException` is thrown.

6. **Data Processing**: 
   - Validation is performed on the incoming CityDTO (details of validation are not visible here, likely defined in the DTO class).
   - Data transformation occurs when converting CityDTO to City entity.
   - The city data is stored in both the database and Redis cache.

7. **Key Classes/Methods**: 
   - `CityController.addCity(CityDTO cityDTO)`
   - `CityServiceImpl.addCity(CityDTO cityDTO)`
   - `CityMapper.INSTANCE.dtoToCity(CityDTO cityDTO)`
   - `CityRepository.save(City city)`

## Update City

1. **Purpose**: Update information for an existing city.

2. **Functionality**: This endpoint updates the details of an existing city in both the database and cache.

3. **Request Structure**:
   - HTTP Method: PUT
   - Path: `/api/v1/city`
   - Request body: CityDTO object

4. **Response Structure**:
   - Response body: Empty
   - Possible status codes: 
     - 201 Created (successful update)
     - 400 Bad Request (if validation fails)
     - 404 Not Found (if city doesn't exist)

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `updateCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The incoming CityDTO is validated (due to `@Valid` annotation).
   - The `cityService.updateCity(cityDTO)` method is called, passing the validated CityDTO.
   - In `CityServiceImpl`, the following steps occur:
     - It checks if the city exists using `cityExists(updatedCity.getName())`.
     - If the city doesn't exist, a `CityNotFoundException` is thrown.
     - If it exists, it converts the CityDTO to a City entity using `CityMapper.INSTANCE.dtoToCity(updatedCity)`.
     - The City entity is saved (updated) in the database using `cityRepository.save(city)`.
     - The updated CityDTO is cached in Redis using `hashOperations.put(generateRedisKey(city.getName()), city.getName(), updatedCity)`.
   - If the update is successful, a 201 Created response is sent with the location of the updated resource.
   - If the update fails, a `CityUpdateException` is thrown.

6. **Data Processing**:
