Based on the provided controller files, I'll analyze the API endpoints and provide detailed notes on their implementation, focusing on data flow analysis.

## Get City

1. **Purpose**: Retrieve information about a specific city.

2. **Functionality**: This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a city based on its name.

3. **Request Structure**:
   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Path: `/api/v1/city/{city}`
   - Path parameters: `city` (String)

4. **Response Structure**:
   - Response body: CityDTO object
   - Possible status codes: 
     - 200 OK (successful retrieval)

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `getCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The `cityService.getCity(city)` method is called, passing the city name.

   - If the city is found, it's returned as an `Optional<CityDTO>`.
   - If the city is not found (Optional is empty), a `CityNotFoundException` is thrown.
   - The controller then returns the CityDTO wrapped in a ResponseEntity.

6. **Data Processing**: 
   - The city data is likely transformed from a database entity to a DTO in the service layer.
   - No explicit caching mechanism is visible in this controller, but there might be caching at the service layer.

7. **Key Classes/Methods**: 
   - `CityController.getCity()`
   - `CityService.getCity()`
   - `CityDTO`

5. **Data Flow**:
   - The request is received by the `addCity` method in `CityController`.
   - The incoming CityDTO is validated using `@Valid` annotation.
   - The `cityService.addCity(cityDTO)` method is called, passing the CityDTO.
   - The service layer likely performs the insertion operation in the database.
   - If successful, a URI for the new resource is created and returned in the Location header.
   - If unsuccessful, a `CityAddException` is thrown.

6. **Data Processing**: 
   - Validation of the incoming CityDTO (using Bean Validation).
   - Transformation and persistence of the city data in the service layer.

7. **Key Classes/Methods**: 
   - `CityController.addCity()`
