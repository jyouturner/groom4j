|Package: com.iky.travel.exception.common
Notes: Package Summary: com.iky.travel.exception.common

This package is dedicated to handling custom exceptions in the application, specifically focusing on common exceptions that may occur across different parts of the system. The package's primary purpose is to provide a structured way of managing and reporting errors related to specific technologies or operations used in the travel application.

Key points about this package:

1. Exception Handling: The package is designed to centralize and standardize exception handling for common scenarios in the application. This approach promotes consistent error reporting and easier error management throughout the codebase.

2. Redis-specific Exception: The package currently contains a single custom exception class, RedisException, which suggests that Redis is a key technology used in the application, likely for caching or as a data store.

3. Unchecked Exceptions: By extending RuntimeException, the RedisException is implemented as an unchecked exception. This design choice allows for more flexible exception handling, as methods using Redis operations don't need to explicitly declare this exception in their signatures.

4. Error Message Propagation: The RedisException class is designed to carry meaningful error messages, which can be crucial for debugging and logging purposes in a production environment.

5. Extensibility: The structure of this package allows for easy addition of other common exceptions in the future, maintaining a clean separation of concerns for different types of errors that may occur in the application.

6. Relationship to Other Packages: While not explicitly stated, this exception package is likely used across various other packages in the com.iky.travel hierarchy, particularly in services or components that interact with Redis.

7. Architectural Implications: The presence of a dedicated exceptions package suggests a well-structured approach to error handling in the overall application architecture, promoting better maintainability and error traceability.

In summary, the com.iky.travel.exception.common package plays a crucial role in the application's error handling strategy, currently focusing on Redis-related errors but designed with the flexibility to accommodate other common exceptions as the application evolves. This approach contributes to the robustness and maintainability of the travel application.

The package plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and facilitating easier management of configuration values across the application.

Key components and their purposes:

1. ApiPathConstants.java:
   - Defines constant API path prefixes for routing in the travel application.
   - Includes constants for API version, travel-related endpoints, and city-related endpoints.
   - Facilitates consistent API path construction and easier management of API versioning.

2. MongoConstant.java:
   - Contains a single constant for the MongoDB database name ("travel").

All three classes follow the utility class pattern, with private constructors to prevent instantiation, as they are designed to be used solely for their static constants.

Notable design principles:
1. Separation of Concerns: By isolating constants into separate files based on their domain (API paths, MongoDB, Redis), the package adheres to the principle of separation of concerns.
2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Centralizing these constants in one package helps avoid duplication and ensures consistency throughout the application.
3. Encapsulation: The use of final static fields and private constructors encapsulates the constant values, preventing unintended modifications.

This package likely has relationships with other packages in the application, particularly those dealing with API controllers, database operations, and caching mechanisms. The constants defined here are probably widely used across the application to reference API endpoints, database names, and cache keys.

Overall, this package plays a vital role in the application's architecture by providing a single source of truth for common constants, which enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of inconsistencies in the codebase.
