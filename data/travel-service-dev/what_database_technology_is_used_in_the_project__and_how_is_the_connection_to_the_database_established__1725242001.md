Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What database technology is used in the project, and how is the connection to the database established?

Based on the provided information and code snippets, we can conclude the following:

1. Database Technology:
   The project uses MongoDB as its database technology. This is evident from several factors:
   
   a. The presence of MongoConfig.java, which is a configuration class specifically for MongoDB.
   b. The use of MongoDB-specific classes like MongoClient and MongoTemplate in MongoConfig.java.
   c. The CityRepository interface extends MongoRepository, which is a Spring Data interface for MongoDB operations.

2. Connection Establishment:
   The connection to the MongoDB database is established using Spring Data MongoDB, which is part of the larger Spring Data project. Here's how the connection is set up:

   a. MongoClient Injection:
      - The MongoConfig class has a constructor that takes a MongoClient as a parameter.
      - This suggests that the MongoClient is being automatically configured and injected by Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.
      - The actual connection details (like host, port, credentials) are likely specified in a configuration file, but we don't see an application.properties or application.yml file in the provided project structure.

   b. MongoTemplate Configuration:
      - The MongoConfig class defines a @Bean method called mongoTemplate().
      - This method creates and returns a MongoTemplate instance, which is a key class in Spring Data MongoDB for performing database operations.
      - The MongoTemplate is initialized with the injected MongoClient and a database name (MONGO_DB_NAME).

   c. Database Name:
      - The database name is specified as a constant MONGO_DB_NAME, which is imported from a MongoConstant class.
      - This suggests that database configuration details are centralized in constant files for easy management.

3. Spring Integration:
   - The @Configuration annotation on the MongoConfig class indicates that this is a Spring configuration class.
   - Spring's dependency injection is used to provide the necessary MongoDB components (like MongoClient) to the application.

4. Repository Layer:
   - The CityRepository interface extends MongoRepository<City, String>, which provides a set of standard CRUD operations for the City entity.
   - It also defines custom query methods like findByName and deleteByName, which are automatically implemented by Spring Data MongoDB based on the method names.
   - This repository provides an abstraction layer over the MongoDB operations, allowing for easier data access and manipulation.

It's worth noting that we don't see the specific connection details (like host, port, or credentials) in the provided code snippets. These are typically specified in application properties or YAML files, which are not visible in the given project structure. The absence of these files in our search results suggests that they might be located in a different directory or that the project might be using alternative ways to configure these details (such as environment variables or external configuration sources).

In conclusion, the project uses MongoDB as its database technology, with the connection established through Spring Data MongoDB. The configuration is centralized in the MongoConfig class, which sets up the necessary beans for MongoDB operations. The actual connection details are not visible in the provided snippets, and Spring Boot's auto-configuration is leveraged to simplify the setup process. The CityRepository interface demonstrates how the application interacts with the MongoDB database using Spring Data's repository abstraction.
