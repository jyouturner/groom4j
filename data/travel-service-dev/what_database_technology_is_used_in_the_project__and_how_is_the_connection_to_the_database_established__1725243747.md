Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What database technology is used in the project, and how is the connection to the database established?

Based on the provided information and the additional materials, we can conclude the following:

1. Database Technology:
   The project uses MongoDB as its database technology. This is evident from the MongoConfig.java file in the com.iky.travel.config package and the use of MongoDB-specific classes and annotations.

2. Connection Establishment:

   a. Configuration:
   - The connection to MongoDB is established using Spring Data MongoDB, which is part of the larger Spring Data project.
   - The MongoConfig class is annotated with @Configuration, indicating that it provides bean definitions for the Spring container.

   b. MongoClient:
   - The MongoConfig class has a constructor that takes a MongoClient as a parameter. This MongoClient is injected by Spring, suggesting that the actual connection details (like host, port, credentials) are defined elsewhere, possibly in an application.properties or application.yml file.

   c. MongoTemplate:
   - The mongoTemplate() method in MongoConfig is annotated with @Bean, which creates a MongoTemplate bean to be managed by the Spring container.
   - MongoTemplate is initialized with the injected MongoClient and a database name (MONGO_DB_NAME).

   d. Database Name:
   - The database name is defined as a constant MONGO_DB_NAME in the MongoConstant class. Its value is set to "travel".

3. Spring Data MongoDB Integration:
   - The project leverages Spring Data MongoDB for database operations, as evidenced by the use of MongoTemplate and the overall configuration structure.

4. Dependency Injection:
   - The MongoClient is injected into the MongoConfig class, demonstrating the use of dependency injection, a core feature of the Spring framework.

Key points about the database connection:

1. The MongoConfig class is responsible for setting up the MongoDB connection.
2. It uses a MongoClient, which is injected by Spring. This suggests that the actual connection details are defined elsewhere in the application configuration.
3. The MongoTemplate is created using the injected MongoClient and the database name "travel".
4. The database name is centralized in the MongoConstant class for easy management and consistency across the application.

It's worth noting that we couldn't find an application.properties or application.yml file in the provided project structure. These files typically contain the actual connection details (host, port, credentials) for the MongoDB instance. The absence of these files in our view suggests that they might be located in a different part of the project structure or that the connection details are being provided through environment variables or some other external configuration mechanism.

The TravelBeApplication.java file, which is the main entry point of the application, doesn't provide any additional information about the database connection. It's a standard Spring Boot application class that bootstraps the application.

To get a complete picture of the database setup, it would be helpful to locate these configuration files or determine how the MongoClient is being configured with the necessary connection details. However, based on the current information, we can't definitively say where these connection details are stored.

In conclusion, the project uses MongoDB as its database technology, with the connection established through Spring Data MongoDB. The configuration is set up in the MongoConfig class, which uses dependency injection to receive a MongoClient. The actual connection details are not visible in the provided files, indicating they are likely managed externally to the visible codebase, possibly through environment variables or external configuration files.

To further investigate this, we might need to look for additional configuration files or environment variables that could contain the MongoDB connection details.
