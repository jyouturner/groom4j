Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: What API framework or technology (e.g., Spring MVC, JAX-RS) is used to expose the data?

Based on the information provided, we can confidently conclude that this project uses Spring MVC as the API framework to expose the data. Here's the analysis that supports this conclusion:

1. Use of Spring MVC Annotations:
   The CityController.java file contains several Spring MVC-specific annotations:
   - @RestController: This annotation is a specialized version of @Controller in Spring MVC. It's used to create RESTful web services and combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
   - @RequestMapping: Used at the class level to define the base URL path for all endpoints in this controller.
   - @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: These annotations are used to map HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to specific handler methods.

2. Controller Structure:
   The CityController class follows the typical structure of a Spring MVC controller:
   - It's annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping.
   - It contains methods annotated with specific HTTP method mappings (@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.).
   - These methods return ResponseEntity objects, which is a common practice in Spring MVC for controlling the HTTP response.

3. Dependency Injection:
   The controller uses constructor-based dependency injection for CityService, which is a common pattern in Spring applications.

4. Use of Spring Web Annotations:
   - @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL path.
   - @RequestBody is used to bind the request body to a method parameter.
   - @Valid is used for validating input, which integrates with Spring's validation framework.

5. Exception Handling:
   The controller throws custom exceptions (e.g., CityNotFoundException, CityAddException) which are likely handled by a global exception handler, another feature commonly used in Spring MVC applications.

6. Response Handling:
   The use of ResponseEntity to wrap responses and set HTTP status codes is a standard practice in Spring MVC.

7. URI Building:
   The controller uses ServletUriComponentsBuilder, a Spring class, to build URIs for newly created resources.

These findings provide strong evidence that the project is built using Spring MVC as the API framework. Spring MVC is part of the larger Spring Framework and is widely used for building web applications and RESTful web services in Java.

The use of Spring MVC in this project implies:
1. The application follows a Model-View-Controller architecture, with clear separation of concerns.
2. RESTful endpoints are defined using annotations within the controller classes.
3. The application likely uses Spring's dependency injection for managing components and their dependencies.
4. Data binding, validation, and other web-related features are handled by Spring MVC's built-in capabilities.
5. The project probably uses other Spring features for aspects like security, data access, and configuration management.

In conclusion, this project clearly uses Spring MVC to expose its API endpoints, leveraging many of the framework's features for building robust and maintainable RESTful web services.
