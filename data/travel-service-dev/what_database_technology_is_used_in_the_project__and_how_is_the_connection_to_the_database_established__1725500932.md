Based on the new information provided in the application.yaml file, I can now provide a more comprehensive and accurate answer to the question about the database technologies used in the project and how the connections are established.

1. Database Technologies:
   a. MongoDB: This is confirmed as the primary database used for storing and retrieving data in the application.
   b. Redis: This is confirmed as being used, likely as a caching layer to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

2. MongoDB Connection:
   The connection to MongoDB is established using Spring Data MongoDB. Here are the specific details:

   a. Connection URI:
      - The MongoDB connection is configured using a URI in the application.yaml file:
        ```yaml
        spring:
          data:
            mongodb:
              uri: mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/travel
        ```
      - This URI includes the username, password, host (localhost), port (27017), and database name (travel).

   b. Health Check:
      - MongoDB health checks are enabled:
        ```yaml
        management:
          health:
            mongo:
              enabled: true
        ```
      - This allows the application to monitor the MongoDB connection status.

3. Redis Connection:
   Redis is set up, likely as a caching layer. The connection details are as follows:

   a. Connection Properties:
      - The Redis connection is configured in the application.yaml file:
        ```yaml
        spring:
          data:
            redis:
              host: localhost
              port: 6379
        ```
      - This specifies that Redis is running on the local machine (localhost) on the default port 6379.

   b. Health Check:
      - Redis health checks are enabled:
        ```yaml
        management:
          health:
            redis:
              enabled: true
        ```
      - This allows the application to monitor the Redis connection status.

4. Additional Configuration:
   - The application has Spring Cloud Config disabled:
     ```yaml
     spring:
       cloud:
         config:
           enabled: false
     ```
     This suggests that the application is not using an external configuration server.

   - Detailed health information is enabled for all actuator endpoints:
     ```yaml
     management:
       endpoint:
         health:
           show-details: always
     ```
     This provides more comprehensive health check information, which can be useful for monitoring both MongoDB and Redis connections.

In conclusion, the project uses MongoDB as its primary database and Redis, likely for caching. The connections are established through Spring Boot's auto-configuration, with specific connection details provided in the application.yaml file. MongoDB uses a full connection URI, while Redis uses separate host and port configurations. Both databases have health checks enabled, allowing for monitoring of their connection status.

This configuration aligns with and confirms our previous analysis of the MongoConfig and RedisConfig classes, as well as the usage patterns observed in the service classes. The application.yaml file provides the specific connection details that were previously inferred to exist.

With this information, we now have a complete picture of the database technologies used and how their connections are established in the project. No further information is needed to answer the original question.
