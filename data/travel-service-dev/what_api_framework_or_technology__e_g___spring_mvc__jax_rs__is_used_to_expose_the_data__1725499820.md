Based on the provided information from the CityController.java and TravelController.java files, I can confidently answer the question about the API framework or technology used to expose the data in this project.

The API framework used in this project is Spring MVC. This conclusion is drawn from the following observations:

1. Use of Spring annotations:
   - Both controller classes are annotated with @RestController, which is a Spring-specific annotation used to create RESTful web services.
   - The classes use @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping annotations, which are all part of the Spring MVC framework.

2. ResponseEntity usage:
   - The controllers return ResponseEntity objects, which is a Spring class used to represent the entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body.

3. Dependency injection:
   - The controllers use constructor-based dependency injection, which is a common practice in Spring applications.

4. Use of Spring's ServletUriComponentsBuilder:
   - In the CityController, ServletUriComponentsBuilder is used to build URIs for newly created resources, which is a Spring utility class.

5. Validation:
   - The @Valid annotation is used on request bodies, which integrates with Spring's validation framework.

These features are all characteristic of Spring MVC, which is a module of the larger Spring Framework designed specifically for building web applications and RESTful web services.

The project appears to be using Spring Boot as well, given the structure and conventions observed. Spring Boot is built on top of Spring MVC and provides additional conveniences for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

In conclusion, the API framework used to expose the data in this project is Spring MVC, likely within a Spring Boot application context. This provides a robust, widely-used, and well-documented framework for creating RESTful web services.

I believe I have sufficient information to fully answer the question about the API framework used. No additional information is needed at this point.
