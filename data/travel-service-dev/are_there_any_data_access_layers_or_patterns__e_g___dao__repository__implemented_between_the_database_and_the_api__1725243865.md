Let's inspect the Java project to answer the question: Are there any data access layers or patterns (e.g., DAO, Repository) implemented between the database and the API?

Based on the provided project structure and the search results, we can identify that there is indeed a data access layer implemented in this Java project. Specifically, the project uses the Repository pattern, which is a common data access pattern in Spring-based applications. Let's analyze the relevant components:

1. Repository Pattern:
   The project includes a CityRepository interface, which is annotated with @Repository. This is evident from the search result:
   @Repository: ['src/main/java/com/iky/travel/domain/repository/city/CityRepository.java']

   The @Repository annotation is a Spring stereotype that indicates this interface is a repository, which is responsible for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior typical of a collection of objects.

2. Location in Project Structure:
   The CityRepository is located in the com.iky.travel.domain.repository.city package, which follows a common convention of separating repository interfaces into their own package.

3. MongoDB Integration:
   While we don't have direct evidence of MongoDB configuration (as searches for MongoDB-related properties and annotations returned no results), the presence of a Repository interface suggests that the project is likely using Spring Data for database operations. Spring Data provides a powerful abstraction layer that works with various databases, including MongoDB.

4. Service Layer:
   The project also includes a service layer, as evidenced by the presence of TravelService and its implementation TravelServiceImpl. These are typically used to encapsulate business logic and interact with repositories. The files are located at:
   - src/main/java/com/iky/travel/domain/service/travel/TravelService.java
   - src/main/java/com/iky/travel/domain/service/travel/impl/TravelServiceImpl.java

5. Controller Layer:
   The project has a controller layer, as seen with the TravelController, which would typically handle HTTP requests and responses, interacting with the service layer. This is located at:
   - src/main/java/com/iky/travel/controller/travel/TravelController.java

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that:

1. The project implements the Repository pattern as its data access layer, evidenced by the CityRepository interface.
2. There is a clear separation of concerns with distinct layers for controllers, services, and repositories.
3. The project likely uses Spring Data for database operations, although we don't have direct evidence of the specific database being used (MongoDB configuration details are not visible in the provided information).
4. The architecture follows common Spring Boot practices for organizing data access, business logic, and API endpoints.

To get a more comprehensive understanding of the data access layer, it would be helpful to examine the contents of the CityRepository interface and any related configuration files.
